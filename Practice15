Encapsulation : 
    The process of grouping data members and corresponding methods into a single unit is known as Encapsulation.(Wrapping up data members and funtions.)
    
    Fully encapsulated class :- 
        all data members are private. 
        so all these data members can be accessed in same class.

    Advantages :-
        Information Hiding / Data Hiding - Security aspects 
        If we want , we can make class - "Read only"
        Code Reusability
        Unit Testing
